*textobj-syntax* is a Vim plugin to provide |text-objects| to select one or
more items which are syntax highlighted.

For example, if you edit the following line in your vimrc, characters which
are underlined with "~" are syntax highlighted.

	nnoremap <silent> ql  :<C-u>clist<Return>
	~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~      ~~~~~     ~~~~~~~~

So |<Plug>(textobj-syntax-a)| and |<Plug>(textobj-syntax-i)| (which are mapped
from  |ay| and |iy| by default) select one of the underlined items if the
cursor is located at the one of them.


Requirements:
- Vim 7.2 or later
- |textobj-user| 0.3.8 or later (vimscript#2100)
